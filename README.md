> High school student in the UK. My hobby (and hopefully future career :) is programming.

_Currently Learning_: Unity

## About Me
Hello, I am a student in the UK, currently in secondary school (high school). I have been programming since I was 7, and I have worked in several languages and frameworks (more about this later).
  
I first got into programming because I wanted to make video games, which I now am learning to do, in Unity.  
I play games like Minecraft, AoE4, Astroneer, Satisfactory, CoD, Counterstrike, Hitman and Cities: Skylines.
